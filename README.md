# EduVault Chain
Student Management System, that is built on top of Ethereum Blockchain. This decentralized application can be effectively used for managing the not only the attendance of the students but also the marks scored by each student and store them safely on Blockchain Ledger

## Background
One can never deny the fact that Educational Records for a Student are incredibly imperative data. These records hold to play a major role even after a student completes a particular course.
However, such imperative records and academic data are still stored in a centralized manner. They are still accessible to only a few hands who hold enormous power over these data.

The current way of storing and modifying Educational Records allows a very small number of participants full access to create, delete as well as modify existing data in ways that might not be good for other the students as well as other members.
Moreover, the current system involves layers of abstraction due to which the system loses transparency and students' data are always at risk of inappropriate manipulation.

While the ugly face of such systems is quite clear, its time to come up with some effective yet reliable solutions.
This is exactly where **EduVault Chain comes into play.**

## How EduVault Solves the Issue?

EduVault Chain is decentralized platform that lets us store Educational and Academic data in the most transparent, trustworthy, and secure way possible. 

* Built on Ethereum Blockchain, EduVault Chain emphasizes more on transparency and elimination of academic data manipulation.
* This Dapp not only stores Academic Data of students but also allows to store the daily attendance of the student since attendance too are imperative these days.

* EduVault Chain maintains the transparency by properly storing not only the time when data is added but also the address of the Teacher who adds the data.
Most importantly, the addition of data can only be done by a selected Admin. No third party can manipulate the data once added.

* Moreover, if the current Admin is found malicious, there is always an option to transfer all the power of the previous admin to a new admin. The previous Admin holds no power once removed.
